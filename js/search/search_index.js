By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n                   TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nDefinitions.\n\"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\nTo \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\nA \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\nTo \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\nTo \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\nAn interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\nSource Code.\nThe \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\nA \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\nThe \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\nThe \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\nThe Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\nThe Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\nBasic Permissions.\nAll rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\nYou may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\nConveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\nProtecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\nNo covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\nWhen you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\nConveying Verbatim Copies.\nYou may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\nYou may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\nConveying Modified Source Versions.\nYou may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\na) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\nit, and giving a relevant date.\nb) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\nreleased under this License and any conditions added under section\n\nThis requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n\"keep intact all notices\".\n\nc) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\nLicense to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\nLicense will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\nadditional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\nregardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\npermission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\ninvalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\nd) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\nAppropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\ninterfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\nwork need not make them do so.\nA compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\nConveying Non-Source Forms.\nYou may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\na) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\nCorresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange.\nb) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\nwritten offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\nlong as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\nmodel, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\ncopy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\nproduct that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\nmedium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\nmore than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\nconveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\nCorresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\nc) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\nwritten offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\nalternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\nonly if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\nwith subsection 6b.\nd) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\nplace (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\nCorresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\nfurther charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\nCorresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\ncopy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\nmay be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\nthat supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\nclear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\nCorresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\nCorresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\navailable for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\ne) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\nyou inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\nSource of the work are being offered to the general public at no\ncharge under subsection 6d.\nA separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\nA \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\nIf you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\nThe requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\nCorresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\nAdditional Terms.\n\"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\nWhen you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\na) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\nterms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\nb) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\nauthor attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\nNotices displayed by works containing it; or\nc) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\nrequiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\nreasonable ways as different from the original version; or\nd) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\nauthors of the material; or\ne) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\ntrade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\nf) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\nmaterial by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\nit) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\nany liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\nthose licensors and authors.\nAll other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\nIf you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\nAdditional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\nTermination.\nYou may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\nHowever, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\nMoreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\nTermination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\nAcceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\nYou are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\nAutomatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\nEach time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\nAn \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\nPatents.\nA \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\nA contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\nEach contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\nIn the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\nIf you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\nIf, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\nA patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\nNothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\nNo Surrender of Others' Freedom.\nIf conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\nRemote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\nRevised Versions of this License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\nLater license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\nDisclaimer of Warranty.\nTHERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\nLimitation of Liability.\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\nInterpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\nIf the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  How to Apply These Terms to Your New ProgramsIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\nCopyright (C)   \nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published\nby the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU Affero General Public License for more details.\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\nalong with this program.  If not, see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/.\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL,

Otherwise maintenance problems will arise to ensure that data remains consistent. Therefore interfaces of a component that may be used by other components are designed call-by-value and not call-by-reference.\n\n\nHomogeneitySolve similar problems in similar ways and establish a uniform code-style.\n\nOverview\nThe following figure shows the general architecture approach for the HPI-Schul-Cloud. It contains two different architecture categories (business architecture and technical architecture), which are described in more detail bellow.\n\nBusiness Architecture\nThe business architecture divides the application into business components. A business component has a well-defined responsibility that it encapsulates. All aspects related to that responsibility have to be implemented within that business component. Further the business architecture defines the dependencies between the business components. These dependencies need to be free of cycles. A business component exports his functionality via well-defined interfaces as a self-contained API. A business component may use another business component via its API and compliant with the dependencies defined by the business architecture.\nThe business components in the architecture should be the output of the business architecture created and managed by the product owner and it must stay aligned with the implementation to provide actual value. If their components are hard to implement (e.g. because technically, there is a very high cohesion between two components), the business component model should be changed. The business architecture has a very high impact on the solution and should therefore (especially in a agile environment) be the result of a mix team (business and development).\nThe application might contain components, which are not part of the business architecture, but have a technical background (e.g. a complex adapter component used to connect to an external system).\nTechnical Architecture\nThe technical architecture divides the application into technical ***layers\\* based on the multilayered architecture. A layer is a unit of code with the same category such as service or presentation logic. A layer is therefore often supported by a technical framework. Each business component can therefore be split into component parts\\ for each layer.\nComponents\nFollowing separation-of-concerns we divide an application into components using our folder-conventions and the architecture-mapping (see Architecture Mapping to Code). Components must use the UseCase-Facade of other components to communicate with them. Never access any other code from a different component directly.\nFor the HPI Schul-Cloud, we have two major types of components\nBusiness Components\nThese usually manage one or more entities and provide the related business logic to other components and external systems.\nAdapter Components\nAdapter components encapsulate interactions with external systems:\n\nrequests to an external system like a chat system, microservices etc.\nrequests from external systems, but only if:\nthe external system needs a specific API (e.g. a public standard for user/class management)\nthere are other (non-)functional requirements, which make it reasonable to encapsulate the interface into its own component, for example:\na reporting API, which aggregates data of multiple components\nAPIs, which have different security requirements\n\n\nOtherwise, the standard API provided by business components should be used\n\n\n\nHow to use Components\nCommunication between components\nIf component B needs anything from component A, it must always access it using the UseCase Facade of A. The general rules are:\n\nOnly the logic exposed in the UseCase facade can be invoked by other components. All other logic must not be called directly. This provides a clean and defined interface, which can be tested and validated.\n\naccessing the datalayer directly would heavily impact maintainability and encapsulation\naccessing the service layer makes no sense because it contains protocol specific aspects and overhead, which is not relevant within the application\n\n\nIn some cases, it is reasonable for the service layer of component B to call the UseCase facade of component A directly\n\nfor example if component B has no business logic (like a simple adapter component)\nIn any other situation, you should only put it into the business logic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvide dedicated APIs for external systems\nIf external applications can't use the default REST API of the system (e.g. because they expect application specific endpoints), those endpoints are provided as a separate component. For example, if an external MyLearningApp Application want's to connect to the HPI Schul-Cloud, create a new component called \"MyLearningAppAdapter\", which maps the external requests from the app to the internal datamodel and calls the use-case facade. Additional Hints:\n\nDo not access the Service Layer, the Data-Access Layer or the actual data in the database of the target component from this adapter component. Only access the UseCase-Facade. By doing this, we ensure that there are no side-effects introduced and the logic layer has full control over the business logic/rules.\nThe adapter component can contain it's own logic layer, if there is actual logic related to providing the interface (e.g more complex mapping and validation rules).\nThe adapter component can also contain a data-access layer, which for example caches data for the responses, contains mapping rules or buffers data from requests for processing.\nDo not use any relations, constraints or other dependencies onto the target component(s) on database level and do not query the data directly. Always use the UseCase Facade\n\n\nAn adapter component can contain multiple endpoints (e.g. for users, courses and classes) and the adapter is allowed to access multiple business components (e.g. to retrieve data from users, courses and classes).\n\n The figure above shows the generic setup. As stated above, the adapter component can access additional components\nAccessing an external API / System\nUsually, access to an external system should be encapsulated in it's own component. This adapter component is responsible for the mapping between the internal and external datamodel and all the protocol and system specific logic. The guidelines are:\n\nIn many cases, external system specific logic is encapsulated in it's own adapter component\nThe component should have an abstract name, e.g. instead of \"RocketChatAdapter\", it should be \"ChatAdapter\". That way, we reduce the amount of changes in the code, if we replace the system.\n\n\nThere are cases, in which the client to an external system could be part of a business component. Thats allowed, if the following conditons are true:\nIt will not be reused/called directly by other components. All calls must go through this business components usecase facade and obviously, the logic must fit into the components responsibility.\nit's very simple or tightly related to an entity managed by the business component, e.g.\nif course content is not stored in a database but in a third party LMS. In that case, the external system is the actual \"repository\" of the data and the client for it belongs in the dataaccess layer\na component managing addresses could contain a client which calls an external application to validate addresses.\n\n\n\n\nan adapter component provides a business interface (use case oriented)\nadapter components can provide their own REST API / service layer, but don't have to\nprovided APIs should also be business oriented and not system specific\n\n\nthe actual client and protocol logic (rest client, etc.) is located in the dataaccess layer\nAn adapter component can contain multiple clients for different services (e.g. rocketchat and matrixchat)\nIf a framework encapsulates the protocol specific logic enough, the framework can be used as \"dataaccess layer\"\n\n\nThe dataaccess layer can also contain entites and db repositories. This might be the case if the adapter component caches or buffers data or needs to manage mapping master data/rules\nthe logic layer is usually rather empty and contains only mapping and data-enrichment logic\nIt can also contain logic to determine the correct dataaccess-layer-client (e.g. if bundesland=x, use rocketchat, otherwise use matrix chat)\n\n\n\nScenarios:\nWith Adapter Component\n\nWith Business Component\n\nAccess Legacy Code\nIf you need to access legacy code (not yet migrated to the new architecture), you can do it from the logic layer (preferred) or the service layer (if there is no logic layer or it is only needed for service-layer-mapping)\n\nExtract Component into external system (Microservice)\nThe component approach not only increases the maintainability and test-ability by a large amount, it also allows to extract components into separate applications without large refactorings. The components are already decoupled and the required functionality in the UseCase Facade can be pulled up into the REST-API.\n\nLayers\nUI Layer\nThe UI layer is implemented as single-page-application using the https://nuxtjs.org/ framework, which wraps the https://vuejs.org/ framework. It should contain only logic related to:\n\npresentation\nsimple form validation\nlocalization\n\nThe client architecture uses an atomic design approach. For details, please check the client-architecture documentation.\nService Layer\nThe service layer is responsible for exposing functionality made available by the logical layer to *external consumers *over a network via technical protocols. By doing this, it decouples the logic layer completely from any protocols or frameworks used to provide logic to the outside world. The service layer can actually contain multiple services for all kinds of protocols (e.g. REST, Sockets, Kafka Messages and so on), which all map protocol specific requests to the protocol-independent logic layer.\nThe service layer in the project uses the feathers/express framework to expose RESTful/socket APIs to the legacy client and NUXT client as well as any other authorized consumer.\nThe layer ensures that the API specification contract is fulfilled, but also handles a large set of cross-cutting-concerns. Its most important tasks are:\n\nEnsure authentication, authorization ((Student-,Teacher-,Admin-)Role/Permissions only)\nRequest/Response validation against the API specification\nMapping form the internal data model to the external view (e.g. remove security critical information, technical keys etc.)\nProvide old versions of an API and map to the new business logic (this is not always possible in the service layer)\nGlobal error handling i.e. translates Application Exception into protocol specific errors\nCapture trace-information (e.g. request-id, user) and provide them to the application for logging\ncollect monitoring information (e.g. number of requests, response times, error rates etc)\nRequest/response/error logging\n\nCross-cutting-concerns are actually shared across all components (hence the name), but many of them are hooked (aspect oriented programming) around the services in the service-layer und some need a service-specific configuration. For example, a hook, which does role based authorization, is implemented only once and wraps all services. But it needs to know which roles must be checked for specific services and service operations.\nLogic Layer\nThe logic layer is the heart of the application and contains the main business logic. According to our business architecture we divide an application into components, which contains use-cases. Each component provides a usecase facade, which can be used to trigger the business logic for a use case from either:\n\nthe service layer\nfrom another component.\n\nThe logic layer is responsible for the implementation of the business logic according to the specified functional demands and requirements. It therefore creates the actual value of the application. The following additional aspects are also in its responsibility:\n\nValidation based on business rules. For example:\nParents must provide their consent for students bellow 16 years of age\n\n\nAuthorization and data access rights (scope or user specific permission), for example:\nA teacher are not allowed to see courses or students from other schools\n\n\nChoreography: In general, only the logic layer is allowed to call other components or trigger a call to an external system. Exceptions are possible (e.g. if a component has no business logic and therefore no logic layer)\n\nThe service layer must be free from protocol or database specific code and does not make assumptions about which protocol or client called it or where the data is stored. For example:\n\nthe die business layer must not access any HTTP-request parameters or headers directly. It has a defined interface which contains the data independently from the caller.\nit does not throw HTTP specific errors like 404 NotFound. Instead it throws an application specific error, which is mapped to 404 by the general REST API ErrorHandler\nIt does not create SQL or mongoDB queries. Instead it calls a defined interface and the dataaccess layer transform the input parameters into a DB specific query.\n\nUsing this approach, the business layer, which contains the actual logic, is much easier to test, understand and change. For example, it is possible to write xUnit Tests with no dependencies to DBs or protocols.\nDataaccess Layer\nThe data-access layer is responsible for all outgoing connections to access and process data. This is mainly about accessing data from a persistent data-store but also about invoking external services. It provides a more or less business oriented interface - e.g. findUser(userId)- and translates it into an database or database-framework specific query. No matter which database, database framework or protocol-client you use, the interface of the dataaccess layer should be neutral. That means that your interface must also provide parameters for pagination etc.\nThis approach brings a couple of benefits:\n\nSeparation of Concerns: encapsulates DB queries/requests to external services and allows for testing it separately\nIntroduces an abstraction over DB/protocol Connector/framework\nSeparates DB-specific Query Language and Application Specific Search Criteria\nIncreases security level - the DB is not exposed via Rest API, minimizes chance for Non-SQL/SQL-Injections\n\nBatch Layer\nThe batch layer is basically a service layer, which contains code related to batch processing (bulk-oriented, non-interactive, typically long running execution of tasks). For simplicity the term batch or batch job is used for such tasks in the project.\nThe batch layer is responsible for batch processes, whereas the business logic is implemented in the logic layer. Compared to the service layer you may understand the batch layer just as a different way of accessing the business logic. Batches should invoke use cases in the logic layer for doing their work. Only \"batch specific\" technical aspects should be implemented in the batch layer. Example: For a batch, which imports user data from a CSV file, this means that all code for actually reading and parsing the CSV input file is implemented in the batch layer. The batch calls the use case \"create user\" in the logic layer for actually creating the users for each line read from the CSV input file.\nIn practice it is not always appropriate to create use cases in the logic layer for every bit of work a batch should do. Instead, the data access layer can be used directly. An example for that is a typical batch for data retention which deletes out-of-time data. Often deleting out-dated data is done by invoking a single SQL statement. It is appropriate to implement that SQL in a Repository method (provided by the dataaccess layer interface) and call this method directly from the batch. But be careful that this pattern is a simplification which could lead to business logic cluttered in different layers which reduces maintainability of the application. It is a typical design decision you have to take when designing your specific batches.\nCross Cutting Concerns\n\nError Handling\nAn important part of the layered architecture is the handling of errors. In our architecture, errors should either be:\n\nhandled directly (e.g. retry a failed REST-API-Call after a timeout error occurred)\nBubble up un-catched to the generic error handler in the cross cutting concerns layer (which , which knows how to map this error to an external error and return it to the caller.\nIn case of batch jobs, the batch layer catches the error and knows how to handle it (e.g. restart a job, skip a part of the job, stop the job completely etc).\n\n\n\nPlease check the error handling guidelines for details.\nTransaction Handling\nTransactions can span multiple layers and components. A concept is necessary to execute/rollback those transactions.\nTODO: add a link to the concept and describe how it interacts with layers.\nRequest Context\nMultiple crosscutting concerns make it necessary to introduce a \"request context\". This is a set of request specific variables accessible everywhere within the application during a request. For example:\n\neach request will contain a request-specific trace id, which must be added to log messages and audit log entries\neach request is triggered by a user or a batch job. We need to store this trigger in the audit logs\nif we introduce transactions across multiple components (e.g. users and classes), we need a way to share transaction information between components and store the transaction until a commit\n\nBecause this context is required in all layers (especially in the data access layer for audit logging) and in cross cutting hooks, we need a framework/feature, which makes this available for direct access without adding this object to every method signature as input variable. Luckily, the necessary functionality is now part of nodejs: AsyncLocalStorage.\nThe general approach for rest requests:\n\nA request is received\nA hook initializes the request context\nA hook extracts trace information (e.g. traceid and spanid) from the request and adds it to the request context\nA hook authenticates and authorizes the user and stores basic user information (e.g. user id, maybe general permissions roles) in the request context\nIf the user is not authenticated, a \"guest user\" is set in the content with only guest permissions\nFor batch jobs, a technial user must be set in the request context. For the business logic, the technology, channel and user must be hidden behind the request context.\n\n\nThe normal code is executed and can access the request context\nIf the business logic needs data from the request context, it can access it\ncross cutting logic like audit logging can extract the information. E.g. before the data access layer writes a entity change to the database, it retrieves the trace id and the user id from the request context and adds these information to the entity\nIf we make a call to another service (e.g. calendar), we retrieve the trace id from the request context and add it to the outgoing request\nOur logging abstraction retrieves the trace id from the request context and adds it to the log message before writing it to the logfile (actually the console).\n\n\nAfter the response is sent to the client, the request context is \"destroyed\"\n\nCharacteristics of the context:\n\nIt is request specific and destroyed after the request is processed\nData in it are only accessable by the processing o f a specific request, not any other request of the same user or another user!\nIt should only contain very basic information necessary for cross cutting concerns like logging and audit logging. Do not use it to transport all kinds of business data around\n\nImportant: In order to make the code (and especially the business logic) agnostic to the source of a request, the request context should be considered a \"invocation context\". That means that also batch jobs (time based triggerd requests) and anonymous rest request should work the exact same way. That means that:\n\nwe must setup the request context for batch jobs\nwe need technical users for anonymous requests and batch jobs\nsuper users (super heroes) must use the same mechanisms as normal users (no special permission checks etc)\n\nThat way, we can use the same logic for all invocations and the source of an invocation is isolated within the service layer.\nLogging and Tracing\nFor details see the corresponding logging and tracing guidelines.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/nestjs-application/architecture-mapping-to-code.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/nestjs-application/architecture-mapping-to-code.html","title":"additional-page - Architecture Mapping to Code","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nArchitecture mapping to Code\nConventions\nFile structure\nThe server app located in /apps/server is structured like.

The core concepts of NestJS can be extended with ours (like repo).\nFile naming conventions\nIn TypeScript files: for Classes we use PascalCase (names start with uppercase letter), variables use lowercase for the first letter camelCase.\nWhen assigning names, they may end with a concept name:\n\nA Concept might be a known term which is widely used. Samples from NestJS: Controller, Provider, Module, Middleware, Exception, Pipe, Guard, Interceptor.\n\nBeside we have own concepts like comparator, validator (generic ones should not be part of a modules (and located in shared folder btw) or repo, use-case which might be owned by a module.\n\n\nIn file names, we use lowercase and minus in the beginning and end with ..ts\nSamples\n\n\n\nFile name\nClass name\nConcept\nLocation\n\n\n\n\nlogin-user.uc.ts\nLoginUserUc\nuse case\nmodule/uc\n\n\ntext.validator.ts\nTextValidator\nvalidator\nshared/validators\n\n\nuser.repo.ts\nUserRepo\nrepository\nmodule/repo\n\n\nparse-object-id.pipe.ts\nParseObjectIdPipe\npipe\nshared/pipes\n\n\n\nComponents\nComponents are defined as NestJS Modules. \nCommunication between components\nTo access other modules services, it can be injected anywhere.

While the FeathersServiceProvider from the feathers module, has only an abstract implementation for all services, add a concrete service inside your module for a specific feathers-service, like above in FeathersAuthProvider.\nLayered Architecture\nThe different layers use separately defined objects that must be mapped when crossing layers.\n\nNever export entities through the service layer without DTO-mapping which is defined in the controller\nConcepts owned by a layer must not be shared with other layers\n\n\nFurther reading: https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/software-design-architecture/organizing-app-logic/\nService Layer\nA modules service layer is defined within of controllers.\nThe main responsibilities of a controller is to define the REST API interface as openAPI specification and map DTO's to match the logic layers interfaces.\n    @Post()\n    async create(@CurrentUser() currentUser: ICurrentUser, @Body() params: CreateNewsParams): Promise {\n        const news = await this.newsUc.create(\n            currentUser.userId,\n            currentUser.schoolId,\n            NewsMapper.mapCreateNewsToDomain(params)\n        );\n        const dto = NewsMapper.mapToResponse(news);\n        return dto;\n    }JWT-Authentication\nFor authentication, use guards like JwtAuthGuard. It can be applied to a whole controller or a single controller method only. Then, ICurrentUser can be injected using the @CurrentUser() decorator.\nValidation\nGlobal settings of the core-module ensure request/response validation against the api definition. Simple input types might additionally use a custom pipe while for complex types injected as query/body are validated by default when parsed as DTO class.\nFile naming\nComplex input DTOs are defined like [create-news].param.ts (class-name: CreateNewsParam) or [pagination].query.ts (class-name: PaginationQuery)\nWhen DTO's are shared between multiple modules, locate them in the layer-related shared folder.\n\nSecurity: When exporting data, internal entities must be mapped to a response DTO class named like [news].response.dto. The mapping ensures which data of internal entities are exported.\n\nopenAPI specification\nDefining the request/response DTOs in a controller will define the openAPI specification automatically. Additional validation rules and openAPI definitions can be added using decorators. For simplification, openAPI decorators should define a type and if a property is required, while additional decorators can be used from class-validator to validate content.\nMapping\nIt is forbidden, to directly pass a DTO to a use-case or return an Entity (or other use-case result) via REST. In-between a mapper must transform the given data, to protect the logic layer from outside implications.\nThe use of a mapper gives us the guarantee, that\n\nno additional data beside the known properties is published.\nA plain object might contain more properties than defined in TS-interfaces.\nSample: All school properties are published while only name & id are intended to be published.\n\n\nthe API definition is complete\n\nLogic (Domain-) Layer\nThe domain layer assumes a kind of higher-level policy that everything else relies on (Source).\n\nThis means, a controller or a repository must fit this layer.\nSpecific goals of a repository, like query optimization must not be a transparent part of the repository only.\n\nData access Layer\nThe data access layer consists of repositories. A repository takes care to persist domain entities defined in the business layer. As we use decorators in entities to define how they are persisted, they are used in this layer too. The repository does not need to map entities like in the presentation layer as it maps data from/to an external system into the domain and to be used from/in the business layer.\n\nIt's not the task of the business layer to fit a repository. A respository should give the logic layer the ability to persist/make available what is defined in the logic layer. The domain model must be independent from a repository (See Clean Architecture).\n\nSpecific concepts from within of this layer must be hidden for the business layer like database queries, protocol specifics, mapping to data layer. Others like putting multiple persistence rules into transactions is part of the domain layer (while how a transaction is implemented, then is part of the data access layer).\nLogic should not be part of a repository, use logic layer instead.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/nestjs-application/domain-driven-design.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/nestjs-application/domain-driven-design.html","title":"additional-page - Domain driven design","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nDomain driven design\nWhile DDD is not enforced, we still try to follow its goals:\n\nDiscover the domain model by interacting with domain experts and agreeing upon a common set of terms to refer to processes, actors and any other phenomenon that occurs in the domain.\nTake those newly discovered terms and embed them in the code, creating a rich domain model that reflects the actual living, breathing business and it's rules.\nProtect that domain model from all the other technical intricacies involved in creating a web application.\n\nClean Architecture\n \"The Clean Architecture from the golden Uncle Bob archives\"\nFor the 3-layer architecture this means we have to protect the business layer and domain models from the outside world and infrastructure to keep it clean, fast, testable, ready for changes.\nConcepts\nEntities\nNestJS does not cover how to persist entities, the heart of our application. We need a solution that not only transfers data like mongoose, instead we want to define business rules on objects with strong typing added.\nInstead of Interface, Model and Schema which describe the view on data, now we define Entities, that get a DRY possibility to be created, loaded, and persisted using en entity manager. The definition of how an entity relates with others or how it is persisted can be added using decorators.\nSee https://github.com/mikro-orm/mikro-orm#-core-features for further details.\nDomain Services\nDomain Services are most often executed by application layer Application Services / Use Cases. Because Domain Services are a part of the Domain Layer and adhere to the dependency rule, Domain Services aren't allowed to depend on infrastructure layer concerns like Repositories to get access to the domain entities that they interact with. Application Services fetch the necessary entities, then pass them to domain services to run allow them to interact.\nSample: Within of a use case we not depend on a user context from outside while for logging, error handling or in a repository it might be used. Like we see in the clean architecture schema.\nUse Cases\nBeside Concepts NestJS introduces, own services like repositories or use-cases might be created.\nUse cases either return entities (data) to the user through a query (CRUD) or apply a command (do ... ok/err).\nFurther reading: https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/oop-design-principles/command-query-separation/\nThey focus on providing business use cases and should only contain higher logical function calls, that are well-tested and hide their implementation inside of a use-case.\n    /**\n     * Let an existing user create a new user (on same school).\n     * @throws: USER_ALREADY_EXISTS, API_VALIDATION_ERROR\n     * @throws: FORBIDDEN, BAD_REQUEST, INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR, ...\n     */\n    async registerNewUser(creatorId: EntityId, schoolId: EntityId, props: INewUserProps): Promise {\n        this.logger.log(`create new user called by ${creatorId}`);\n\n        // check creator has permission in school to create user\n        await this.authorizationService.checkEntityPermissions(creatorId, School, schoolId, ['USER_CREATE']);\n\n        // check user not exists\n        await this.userService.checkUserNotExistByEmail(props.email)\n\n        const user = new User(props);\n        await this.userRepo.save(user);\n\n        if(enableUserActivation){\n            // call other service which creates pin and sends email\n        }\n\n        if(sendWelcomeEmailToUser){\n            await this.userEmailService.sendWelcomeMessage(user);\n        }\n\n        this.logger.log(`user ${user.id} created by user ${creatorId}`);\n\n        return user;\n    }\n\n\n    // ... userService\n\n    checkUserNotExistByEmail(email: string){\n        // todo email is not empty\n        const existingUser = await this.userRepo.findByEmail(props.email);\n        if(existingUser.length > 0) {\n            throw new UserAlreadyExistError();\n        }\n    }How to structure a use case?

There, we no more see any details about the functional requirements.\nDomain events\nEvents have to be handled very carefully or in best case not to be used. Like hooks around services might lead into separating the business logic into independend untestable workflows, the events task and data must be defined clearly and should only be used for independent tasks.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/nestjs-application/cross-cutting-concerns.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/nestjs-application/cross-cutting-concerns.html","title":"additional-page - Cross-cutting concerns","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nCross cutting concerns\nThe cross cutting topics are implemented within of the core-module. \nLogging\nFor logging use the logger ServerLogger, provided by the logger module. It is hooked up in the application on startup, replacing the default logger and can be transient injected into any provider by additionally define set a context into the logger.\n// add Logger module to your feature module imports or unit tests\nimport { LoggerModule } from '../core/logger/logger.module';\n// ...\nimports: [LoggerModule],\n// within of a provider (use-case, service, ...)\n\n// import the server logger service\nimport { ServerLogger } from '../core/logger/logger.service';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class YourUc {\n    constructor(\n        // initialize a ServerLogger\n        private logger: ServerLogger\n    ) {\n        // set the context by this class name (here: 'YourUc')\n        this.logger.setContext(YourUc.name);\n    }\n\n    async sampleUcMethod(params) {\n        this.logger.log(`start do something...`);\n        // ...\n        this.logger.log(`finished successfully to do something...`);\n    }This produces a logging output like\n[Nest] NUMBER - TIME   [YourUc] start do something...\n[Nest] NUMBER - TIME   [YourUc] finished successfully to do something...Later we can filter the log for a single [context].\nA logger does implement the LoggerService interface:\ninterface LoggerService {\n    log(message: any, context?: string): any;\n    error(message: any, trace?: string, context?: string): any;\n    warn(message: any, context?: string): any;\n    debug?(message: any, context?: string): any;\n    verbose?(message: any, context?: string): any;\n}Only a string should be provided as a single parameter by default. Ensure not putting complex objects into a log. Think about persisting more complex results for later analysis into a database.\nOptionally in the second parameter, the context can be overridden only.\nException Handling\n\nWe separate our business exceptions from technical exceptions. While for technical exceptions, we use the predefined HTTPExceptions from NestJS, business exceptions inherit from abstract BusinessException.\nBy default, implementations of BusinessException must define\n    code: 500\n    type: \"CUSTOM_ERROR_TYPE\",\n    title: \"Custom Error Type\",\n    message: \"Human readable details\",\n    // additional: optionalDataThere is a GlobalErrorFilter provided to handle exceptions, which cares about the response format of exceptions and logging. It overrides the default NestJS APP_FILTER in the core/error-module.\nIn client applications, for technical errors, evaluate the http-error-code, then for business exceptions, the type can be used as identifier and additional data can be evaluated.\nFor business errors we use 409/conflict as default to clearly have all business errors with one error code identified.\n\nSample: For API validation errors, 409/Bad Request will be extended with validationError: ValidationError[{ field: string, error: string }] and a custom type API_VALIDATION_ERROR.\n\nPipes can be used as input validation. To get errors reported in the correct format, they can define a custom exception factory when they should produce api validation error or other exceptions, handled by clients.\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"additional-documentation/nestjs-application/testing.html":{"url":"additional-documentation/nestjs-application/testing.html","title":"additional-page - Testing","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\nTesting\nAutomated testing is the essential part of the software development process. \nIt improves the code quality and ensure that the code operates correctly especially after refactoring. \n\nOur goal is to test each application layer mostly independent of others.\n\nRepo tests operate on data access layer. \nThey prove that the database queries are executed correctly. \nUse case tests operate on logic layer. \nThey verify the correct implementation of the business requirements.\nMapper tests operate between logic and service layer.\nThey verify the correct mapping between domain objects and objects delivered to the clients via REST API.\nEnd-to-end tests operate on all layers of the application. \nThe testing endpoint is the service layer. These tests verify the availability of the expected endpoints and checks \nthe expected status codes and the structure of the received objects.\n\nTesting Utilities\nNestJS:\n\nprovides default tooling (such as test runner that builds an isolated module/application loader)\nprovides integration with Jest and Supertest out of the box\nmakes the Nest dependency injection system available in the testing environment for mocking components\n\nThe @nestjs/testing.Test class provides an execution context that mocks the full Nest runtime, but gives\nhooks that can help to manage class instances, including mocking and overriding.\nThe method Test.createTestingModule() takes module metadata as argument it returns TestingModule instance.\nThe TestingModule instance provides method compile() which bootstraps a module with its dependencies.\nEvery provider can be overwritten with custom provider implementation for testing purposes.\n  beforeAll(async () => {\n      const moduleRef = await Test.createTestingModule({\n          controllers: [SampleController],\n          providers: [SampleService],\n        }).compile();\n\n      sampleService = moduleRef.get(SampleService);\n      sampleController = moduleRef.get(CatsController);\n    });Unit Tests vs Integration Tests\nIn Unit Tests we access directly only the layer which is currently testing. \nOther layers should be mocked or are replaced with default testing implementation.\nEspecially the database access and database calls should be mocked.\nIn contrast to unit tests the integration tests use access to the database and execute\nreal queries using repositories.\nRepo Tests\nFor the data access layer, integration tests can be used to check the repositories base functionality against a database.\nFor Queries care DRY principle, they should be tested very carefully.\n\nUse a in-memory database for testing to allow parallel test execution and have isolated execution of tests. \n\n\nA test must define the before and after state of the data set clearly and cleanup the database after execution to the before state. \n\n\nInstead of using predefined data sets, all preconditions should be defined in code through fixtures.\n\nOur repository layer uses mikro-orm/EntityManager to execute the queries. \nBy testing repositories we want to verify the correct behaviour of the repository functions.\nIt includes verifying expected database state after executed repository function. \nTherefore, the *.repo.integration.spec.js should be used.\nThe basic structure of the repo integration test:\nPreconditions (beforeAll):\n\nDefine MongoMemoryServer\nCreate Nest JS testing module: \n2.1 with MikroOrmModule defining entities which are used in tests.\n2.2 provide the repo which should be tested\nGet repo, orm and entityManager from testing module\n\n    beforeAll(async () => {\n        mongod = new MongoMemoryServer();                               (1)\n        const dbUrl = await mongod.getUri();\n        const module: TestingModule = await Test.createTestingModule({  (2)\n             imports: [\n                 MikroOrmModule.forRoot({                               (2.1)\n                     type: 'mongo',\n                     clientUrl: dbUrl,\n                     entities: [News, CourseNews, ...],\n                 }),\n              ],\n             providers: [NewsRepo],                                     (2.2)                          \n      }).compile();\n      repo = module.get(NewsRepo);                            (3)\n      orm = module.get(MikroORM);\n      em = module.get(EntityManager);\n    })Post conditions (afterAll)\nAfter all tests are executed close the app and orm to release the resources\n    afterAll(async () => {\n        await orm.close();\n        await mongod.stop();         \n    });\nMapping Tests\nMapping tests are Unit Tests which verify the correct mapping between entities and Dto objects. \nThese tests should not have any external dependencies to other layers like database or use cases.\nUse Case Tests\nUse case tests are Unit Tests which verify the business logic of the application. \nThe database calls are mocked and spyied. So we can check how and with which parameters the repo functions are called.\n\nUse unit-tests to ensure a use-cases logic matches the given requirements (from a [user-]story). \n\n\nA unit test should cover preconditions, allowed input, the result, and expected exceptions defined by the story, and roughly what happens on malformed input (the execution should stop).\n\nPreconditions\n\nCreate Nest JS testing module\nUse Repo as provider reimplement the repo functions with some default implementations\nProvide other dependencies like AuthorizationService and provide default implementation for the function, which are called. \nGet repo and uc from testing module\n\n      const module: TestingModule = await Test.createTestingModule({ (1)\n            imports: [LoggerModule],\n            providers: [\n                NewsUc,\n                {\n                    provide: NewsRepo,                                  (2)\n                    useValue: {\n                        save() {\n                            ...\n                        },\n                        findAll() {\n                            ...\n                        },\n                    },\n                },\n                {\n                    provide: AuthorizationService,                      (3)\n                    useValue: {\n                        getPermittedEntities(userId, targetModel, permissions) {\n                            ...\n                        },\n                    },\n                },\n            ],\n        }).compile();\n\n        service = module.get(NewsUc);                           (4)\n        repo = module.get(NewsRepo);Test\n\nSpy repo function which is called inside the tested use case\nCall the tested function\nVerify that the repo spy is called with the expected functions     it('should search for news by empty scope ', async () => {\n         const findAllSpy = jest.spyOn(repo, 'findAll');             (1)\n         await service.findAllForUser(userId, scope, pagination);    (2)\n         const expectedParams = [targets, false, pagination];\n         expect(findAllSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...expectedParams); (3)\n     });\n\nE2E Tests\nUnlike unit testing, which focuses on individual modules, end-to-end testing covers the interaction between classes and\nmodules at a more aggregate level. Automated end-to-end tests help us to ensure that the overall behavior of the system is correct.\nController Tests\nTo test the setup behind a controller, use e2e-tests to ensure, use cases and repositories below \nare correctly mounted and available at a specific path.\n\nA controller unit test should ensure it responds with the correct data-format and a referenced use-case is called correctly.\n\n\nAuthentication and response codes can be unit tested.\n\n\nDo not test logic (from the business layer or repository) in e2e-tests, this must be done where the logic is defined within of a unit test. A e2e test should only ensure everything is correctly initialized.\n\n\nDo not put logic (beside mapping) inside a controller, use the logic layer instead. Mapping can be unit tested.\n\nPreconditions\n\nCreate Nest testing module\n\nImport ServerModule as the whole\n\nOverride authentication using JwAuthGuard\n\n1 Override authorized user with the mocked user data\n\nOverride other services for example for authorization\n\nCreate and initialize the whole Nest Application using createNestApplication()\n\nGet Orm and Entity Manager from module\n\n beforeAll(async () => {\n     const module: TestingModule = await Test.createTestingModule({  (1)\n         imports: [ServerModule],                                    (2)\n     })\n         .overrideGuard(JwtAuthGuard)                                (3)\n         .useValue({\n             canActivate(context: ExecutionContext) {\n                 const req: Request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();\n                 req.user = {                                        (3.1)\n                         userId: '0000d224816abba584714c9c',\n                         roles: [],\n                         schoolId: '5f2987e020834114b8efd6f8',\n                         accountId: '0000d225816abba584714c9d',\n                 };
